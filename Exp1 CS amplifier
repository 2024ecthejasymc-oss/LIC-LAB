Common Source (CS) Amplifier – Simulation and Analysis
 =Aim
To simulate and analyze a Common Source (CS) MOSFET amplifier using LTSpice by performing DC, Transient, and AC analyses and to evaluate parameters such as operating point, voltage gain, and frequency response.

-Components Required:-
- NMOS transistor (nmos4 – TSMC 180 nm technology)
- DC Supply Voltage – 1.5 V
- Load Capacitance (CL) – 1 pF
- Power constraint – 0.5 mW
- Connecting wires

-Theory
The MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) is widely used in analog and digital circuits because of:

- Compact size  
- Low power consumption  
- Simple structure  
- Compatibility with VLSI fabrication  

-MOSFET Amplifier Configurations

1. Common Source (CS)
2. Common Drain (Source Follower)
3. Common Gate

-Common Source Amplifier

In the Common Source configuration:
- Input is applied at the gate terminal.
- Output is taken from the drain terminal.
- The source terminal is common (usually grounded).

- Saturation Condition (for amplification)

The MOSFET must operate in saturation region:
- VGS > VTH  
- VDS ≥ VOV  
- VGD < VTH  

Key Characteristics
- High voltage gain  
- 180° phase shift between input and output  
- High input impedance  
- Voltage Gain (small signal):

- DC Analysis
 Objective
To determine the DC operating point (Q-point) of the MOSFET.

Importance
- Ensures transistor operates in saturation  
- Prevents signal distortion  
- Maintains linear amplification  
- Verifies biasing conditions  

DC Design Calculations
 Step 1: Drain Current from Power Constraint

Total power:
P = VDD × ID
ID = P / VDD
ID = (0.5 mW) / (1.5 V)
ID = 0.333 mA
ID ≈ 333 µA

Step 2: Overdrive Voltage (VOV)
VOV = VGS − VTH
VOV = 0.9 − 0.4  
VOV = 0.5 V

Step 3: Verify Drain Current using MOSFET Equation
For saturation:
ID = (1/2) Kn' (W/L) (VOV)²
W/L = (3 µm) / (0.18 µm)  
W/L = 16.67
ID = (1/2) × 200 µA/V² × 16.67 × (0.5)²
ID = 100 × 16.67 × 0.25  
ID = 416.75 µA

The calculated value is close to required 333 µA  
Hence biasing is approximately correct.

Step 4: Drain Resistor (RD)
For maximum symmetrical swing:
VD ≈ VDD / 2  
VD ≈ 1.5 / 2  
VD ≈ 0.75 V
Voltage across RD:
VRD = VDD − VD  
VRD = 1.5 − 0.75  
VRD = 0.75 V

RD = VRD / ID
RD = 0.75 / 0.333 mA
RD ≈ 2.25 kΩ

Parameters Obtained
- Drain Current (ID)
- Gate-Source Voltage (VGS)
- Drain-Source Voltage (VDS)

A proper Q-point allows maximum symmetrical output swing.

-Transient Analysis

 Objective
To analyze circuit response to a time-varying input signal.

Input Specifications
- DC Bias (VGS) = 0.9 V  
- Signal Amplitude = 50 mV  
- Frequency = 1 kHz

Step 1: Transconductance (gm)
gm = 2ID / VOV
gm = (2 × 0.333 mA) / 0.5
gm = 0.666 mA / 0.5  
gm = 1.332 mS

Step 2: Output Resistance (ro)
ro = 1 / (λID)
Assume λ ≈ 0.1 V⁻¹ (typical for 180nm)
ro = 1 / (0.1 × 0.333 mA)
ro = 1 / (0.0000333)
ro ≈ 30 kΩ

Since ro >> RD, gain mainly depends on RD.

 Observations
- Output waveform is amplified  
- 180° phase inversion observed  
- Any distortion or DC shift can be detected  
This analysis helps evaluate time-domain behavior and speed performance.

- AC Analysis

 Objective
To study small-signal gain and frequency response.

Frequency Sweep
- Start Frequency = 0.1 Hz  
- Stop Frequency = 100 GHz  
- Points per decade = 20

 Voltage Gain Calculation
Voltage Gain:
Av = −gm RD
Av = − (1.332 mS × 2.25 kΩ)
Av = − (1.332 × 2.25)
Av ≈ −3
So expected midband gain ≈ −3 V/V

Parameters Studied
- Midband gain  
- Bandwidth  
- Cutoff frequencies  
- Gain roll-off  

In midband region:
Bandwidth Calculation
Upper cutoff frequency:
fH = 1 / (2π Rtotal CL)

Assuming Rtotal ≈ RD
fH = 1 / (2π × 2.25k × 1pF)
fH = 1 / (2π × 2.25 × 10³ × 10⁻¹²)
fH ≈ 70.7 MHz
So bandwidth ≈ 70 MHz

Gain decreases at high frequencies due to parasitic capacitances.

-Procedure

1. Create a new project folder and save the LTSpice schematic file.
2. Set NMOS parameters:
   - Length = 180 nm
   - Width = 3 µm
   - Model name = CMOSN
3. Apply VDD = 1.5 V.
4. Set gate bias voltage to 0.9 V.
5. Run `.op` for DC analysis.
6. Apply sinusoidal input and run `.tran 3m`.
7. Perform AC sweep using `.ac dec 20 0.1 100G`.
8. Record operating point values, gain, and waveform observations.

-Results and Discussion:-

- MOSFET operates in saturation under proper biasing.
- Output signal is amplified and inverted.
- Gain depends on transconductance (gm) and drain resistance (RD).
- Increasing transistor width increases drain current and gm.
- Maximum gain occurs in the mid-frequency range.
- Gain reduces at very low and very high frequencies.

-Inference
1. Drain current increases with increase in MOSFET width.
2. Saturation region ensures stable and linear amplification.
3. CS amplifier produces negative voltage gain due to phase inversion.
4. Midband region provides maximum small-signal gain.
5. Transient analysis confirms time-domain response and amplification.
6. AC analysis helps determine bandwidth and frequency limitations.

-Conclusion
The Common Source amplifier was successfully simulated using LTSpice.  
DC, Transient, and AC analyses confirm proper saturation operation, voltage amplification with phase inversion, and expected frequency response characteristics.
